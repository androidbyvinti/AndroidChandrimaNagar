Layouts

View --> Predefined class in android -->
	common attributes -->background, text, textcolor, textstyle
	 TextView, Button, EditText

	and listeners --> setOnClickListner()

and 

ViewGroup --> when u want to place some collection of Views then work with ViewGroup

Layout :

RelativeLayout : always align view or viewgroup relative to the
		position of child element or parent

advantage : 1. drag and drop
	    2. set of attributes
	    3. when you have to avoid nested layouts then work with 		relative layout


disadvantage : 1. dependency on siblings or parent
